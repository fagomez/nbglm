## 📌 Project Overview

This project introduces a **statistical framework for identifying structural regimes in internal armed conflicts**, based on a **Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model (NB-GLM)** combined with change-point detection.

The approach is designed to:

- Model highly **overdispersed violence data**
- Detect **escalation and de-escalation phases**
- Incorporate **population-adjusted risk**
- Compare multiple **dimensions of violence**
- Provide a **reproducible and interpretable periodization**

The empirical application uses **monthly data from the Colombian internal armed conflict (1958–2021)**.
